## Instrument

Pling is a precisely recorded music box with unusual playability and the lovely plessure of a divine voice kissed by a kitten.

Recorded with an arsenal of high quality studio microphones we definitly shoot some sparrows with cannons, but ensured to capture the refined sound architecture of this instrument.

The colorful reverb comes from a little church from france near?  and allows the tonality to open up in some euphonic shapes.

# Use the Instrument



##Global Controls



*bild*



The rudimentary controls of the global section are self-explanatory labeled with an ON/OFF switch to bypass Pling and a MASTER knob to control the overall output volume of Pling. The midi indicator lamp practically indicates an incoming midi signal.





##Sound Section



*bild*



Beneath the sound section the envelope control knobs ATTACK and DECAY permit Pling to morph from a percussive to a nearly muted sound. The REVERB AMOUNT knob which could be bypassed with its own ON/OFF switch, also takes care of the overall volume to ensure that the reverb tail doesn't override the stereo output. 



##Noise Section



*bild*



The Noise Section contains two seperate Loop Player which can be enabled via ON/OFF switch and can be panned and controlled in volume independet
